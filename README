Automatic Weather Warning Printer program
Author: Chrissy Hart, KC8UFV, Lucas County AEC for Mesh & IT

Automatically downloads and prints weather warnings on a receipt printer

To install, first configure the file for your local installation by editing the variables near the start of NWSPrinter
You will need to know what the device name of your local Epson printer is. If it's the only USB printer, the default should be correct.
You will also need to know the 3 letter code for your weather office, and a text string that will appear in only the warnings you are 
interested in. Reference previously issued warnings from your weather office. If you want all warnings from the specified office to 
print, set LOCATION="productText"

After configuring the script for your area, install it with the command "sudo bash install". Everything will be automated at that point. 
If you need to change settigns after installation, simply edit /usr/local/sbin/NWSPrinter and either kill the process NWSPrinter, or
restart your computer.

All items sent to the printer will be logged in the specified logfile.
